# SQL-challenge
## Description
We were given a set of .csv files containing information about the employees of Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company).   
The main task was to insert these tables into a Postgres database establishing the columns of each table, the type of values for each column, primary and foreign keys, and create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to relate each table with each other.  
I've included below some screenshots of the ERD and the database schema.

## Analysis  
Once the database was created, some queries were required to analyse the data and confirm that all tables were well related. I've included below some screenshots of the queries executed.
