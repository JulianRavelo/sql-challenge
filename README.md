# SQL-challenge
## Description
We were given a set of .csv files contining information of the employees of Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company).   
The main task was to insert these tables into a Postgres database establishing the columns of each table, the type of values for each column, primary keys, foreign keys, and create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to relate each table with each other.  
Find below some screenshots of the ERD and the database schema.

## Analysis  
Once the database was created, some querys required to analysed the data and confirm that all tables are well related. See below some screenchots of the querys executed.
